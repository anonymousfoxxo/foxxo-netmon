**foxxo-netmon** is a network guardian written in python. This netmon is made spacifically to protect Gta Online players from **modders** and **griefers**. 

This tool offers control over who can enter your session. If you're a lone grinder, enjoy the solitude of a strictly locked **solo session**. On the other hand, add friends to your whitelist and enjoy grinding without being disturbed by unwanted players.

## feature highlights
- **autolock**
  - Automatically detect players present in session over a 30 second window and **lock** the session with those players.
  - These players are not added to your **whitelist**. They are only temporarily allowed to be in your session.

- **whitelist & action logs**
  - Manage your **whitelist** by adding or dropping players by **ip**. Running a **whitelisted session** allows you to make sure only these players can enter your session at any time  
  - Every player added to or dropped from your whitelist is recorded by ip, status and timestamp to the **log database** for future reference.
